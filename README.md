## Description 

For my first project, I have decided to create a movie database website. Creating this website became of interest to me because of how my family and I like to use our free time. We enjoy sitting down to watch a movie together. So of course, prior to deciding on a movie to watch, we always ask ourselves: 
 - What should we watch?
 - What is this movie about?
 - Are there good ratings?

All of these are questions I personally assume everyone asks before deciding to watch a movie. Therefore, I decided to create a webpage that answers the majority of those questions.

## Usage 

When using this app, you will encounter a list of most popular movies. You will see the title, image, the overall rating (rating out of 10), and a brief overview of the movie. 

- To view the summary of the movie, you can hover over the movie image. 

- To search a movie you can use the search box (located at the top right of the page). You may type in a text of any movie you wish to search for. 

    - If you dont remember the name of the movie you wish to search, simply type in any corresponding text related to the movie title and a list of movies will load onto the page that matches your text. 

- To refresh the page clear your search box, hit enter, and you will be back to the original page where you started. 

- To like my webpage, hit the like button on the very bottom of the page. Once successful, you should get an alert saying "Thank you for liking this page!"
