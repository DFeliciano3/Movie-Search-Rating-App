## Description 

For my first project, I have decided to create a movie database website. Creating this website became of interest to me because of how my family and I like to use our free time. We enjoy sitting down to watch a movie together. So of course, prior to deciding on a movie to watch, we always ask ourselves: 
 - What should we watch?
 - What is this movie about?
 - Are there good ratings?

All of these are questions I personally assume everyone asks before deciding to watch a movie. Therefore, I decided to create a webpage that answers the majority of those questions.

## Usage 

When using this app, you will encounter a list of most popular movies. You will see the title, image, the overall rating (rating out of 10.0), and a brief overview of the movie. 

- To view the summary of the movie, you can hover over the movie image. 

- To search a movie you can use the search box (located at the top right of the page). You may type in a text of any movie you wish to search for. 

    - If you dont remember the name of the movie you wish to search, simply type in any corresponding text related to the movie title and a list of movies will load onto the page that matches your text. 

- To refresh the page to go back to where you began, you can click the lovie logo at the top left screen ("MovieFanatic") and you will be back and the list of most popular movies. 

- To subscribe to my webpage, scroll to the very bottom of the page. Enter your email address into the subscription box. Once successful, you should get an alert saying "Thank you for subscribing!"
