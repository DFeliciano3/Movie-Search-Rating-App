## Description 

For my first project, I have decided to create a movie database website. Creating this website became of interest to me because of how my family and I like to use our free time. We enjoy sitting down to watch a movie together. So of course, prior to deciding on a movie to watch, we always as ourselves: 
 - What should we watch?
 - What is this movie about?
 - Are there good ratings?

All of these are questions I personally assume everyone asks before deciding to watch a movie. Therefore, I decided to create a webpage that answers the majority of those questions.
